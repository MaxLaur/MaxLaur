My name's Max. I have just graduated from Concordia full stack web development Bootcamp.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my srp project.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about music, sim racing or tree planting.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've been playing guitar since the age of 9 and I also speak french.

## About me 

Re-discovered coding in 2022 with the game <a href='https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner/' target='blank'>Bitburner</a> and dove right in.
Now I have graduated from a full stack web development bootcamp and looking forward to continue on my journey.
